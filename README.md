[![Node.js CI](https://github.com/typicode/xv/actions/workflows/node.js.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/typicode/xv/actions/workflows/node.js.yml)

Setting up and maintaining a test framework can sometimes be complex and time consuming. I've created `xv` to be a low maintainance, easy to setup and learn test lib/CLI. You can use it in small to medium projects.

## Features

- Pure ESM
- Extremely lightweight
- No config file, only one function `test()`, easy to work with
- Good for simple projects (used by [lowdb](https://github.com/typicode/lowdb) and [steno](https://github.com/typicode/steno))

_Requires Node v14.13.1+_

## Usage

```sh
$ npm install xv --save-dev
$ yarn add xv --dev
```

```js
// src/add.test.js
import { equal } from 'assert/strict'
import { test } from 'xv'

await test('add', () => {
  equal(add(1, 2), 3)
})
```

```sh
$ xv 'src/**/*.test.js' # Run all .test.js files in src/
$ node src/add.test.js  # Run specific file
```

That's all... really :)

## Early access for Sponsors

For a limited time `xv` is available to Sponsors only. Once the goal of 70 sponsors is reached (currently 55), I'll release it under MIT for everyone ðŸŽ‰

If you like this project and my work, you can [become a sponsor here](https://github.com/sponsors/typicode). Thank you for your support!

Note: if you're already sponsoring [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky), feel free to use `xv` in any type of project.

## Assertions

Use Node's [`assert`](https://nodejs.org/api/assert.html) module.

## TypeScript

If you're using TypeScript, build your code before and run `xv` directly on compiled test files.

`tsconfig.json`

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "./lib",
    "module": "ESNext"
  }
}
```

Edit `package.json` to exclude test files from being published.

```js
{
  "files": [
    "lib",
    "!lib/**/*.test.*" // exclude test files
  ],
  "scripts": {
    "build": "rm -rf lib && tsc",
    "test": "npm run build && xv 'lib/**/*.test.js'"
  }
}
```
